📁 File Management Tool (C++ – Read, Write, Append)
This is a simple and beginner-friendly File Management Tool developed in C++. It allows users to perform basic file operations like writing, appending, and reading data from a text file. The tool runs in the terminal and uses standard C++ file I/O libraries (<fstream>) to interact with the file system.

🚀 Features
✅ Write to a file: Overwrites existing content with new input.

✅ Append to a file: Adds new data to the end of an existing file without removing old content.

✅ Read from a file: Displays the current contents of the file in the terminal.

✅ Simple CLI Menu: Users can select the desired operation through a terminal-based menu.

🛠 Technologies Used
C++ (Standard I/O)

<fstream>, <iostream>, <string>

Console-based user input

🧠 How It Works
When the program runs:

It displays a menu with options to write, append, read, or exit.

Based on the user’s choice, it performs the respective operation on a predefined text file (data.txt).

Input ends when the user types END (for write/append), allowing multi-line entries.

The file is automatically created if it doesn't already exist.

📦 Example Use Case
Maintaining logs

Storing user notes

Learning file handling in C++

Simple data entry systems

📝 Requirements
A C++ compiler (like g++, MSVC)

A terminal/command-line interface
